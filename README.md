## About the Dataset

The **[Real or Fake] : Fake Job Description Prediction Dataset** is a collection of job descriptions designed for the purpose of creating classification models capable of distinguishing between genuine and fraudulent job postings. The dataset consists of 18,000 job descriptions, with approximately 800 of them labeled as fake. These job descriptions are accompanied by both textual information and meta-information related to the jobs.

## Dataset Details

| Attribute          | Description                                                                                     |

| Source            | Curated by the Laboratory of Information & Communication Systems Security at the University of the Aegean. |
| Objective         | Enable the development and evaluation of machine learning models for detecting fraudulent job descriptions. |
| Contents          | - Textual Information: The text of the job descriptions, providing core content for analysis and classification. <br> - Meta-information: Additional details about the jobs, enhancing classification models. |
| Size              | 18,000 job descriptions, subset of around 800 job descriptions marked as fake.                |

## Applications

- **Classification Models**: Researchers and data scientists can employ the dataset to train classification models that use both text data features and meta-features to predict whether a given job description is genuine or fraudulent.
- **Feature Identification**: Analysis of the dataset can help identify key traits and features associated with fraudulent job descriptions, aiding in the creation of more effective detection mechanisms.
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Contextual embedding models can be applied to find similarities between job descriptions, revealing patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Exploring the dataset can uncover insights about the distribution of real and fake job descriptions, as well as common linguistic patterns in each category.
